# Codsoft_Task-2
Thrilled to share second latest project #CODSOFT_TASK-2 as part of my AI internship with CodSoft! ðŸŽ‰
I've just completed  on creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. This project was an exciting task assigned during my internship, allowing me to dive deep into game development and Python programming.
In this video, I guide you through the process of building a Tic-Tac-Toe game from scratch, covering everything from setting up the game board to implementing the game logic. It was a fantastic learning experience, and I hope it inspires and helps others interested in Python and game development.
Check out the video and share your feedback!
